# Welcome to GoiPay

GoiPay is a lightweight cryptocurrency payment processor microservice, written in Golang, designed for creating and processing cryptocurrency invoices via gRPC.

It was built as a service-to-service solution with limited functionality, primarily focusing on the basic features described above, so you can easily integrate it into your own projects.
